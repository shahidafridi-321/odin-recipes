    <h2>Delicious Meal Cooking</h2>
    <p>This hearty pot roast makes its own gravy thanks to onion 
        soup mix and canned cream of mushroom soup. "It's designed 
        especially for the working person who does not have time to cook all day, 
        but it tastes like you did," says recipe creator Brenda Arnold.
